        <span class="post-date">2018-03-17</span>
        

<p>It may have been a while coming, at least compared to <a href="https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/">Jenkins Pipeline</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a>, and friends, but VSTS now offers the facility to specify your build pipeline as YAML, meaning it can be version controlled with your application code. YAML Release Management Pipelines are &ldquo;on the way&rdquo;, but not yet publically available.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The YAML Build is. The release is not yet.  <a href="https://t.co/FCHfdfMHd7">https://t.co/FCHfdfMHd7</a></p>&mdash; Donovan Brown (@DonovanBrown) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonovanBrown/status/971796151862222848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>YAML Build Definitions are currently in public preview, so you&rsquo;ll need to ensure you have the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/collaborate/preview-features">feature enabled for your account</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-sample-project">The Sample Project</h2>

<p>We don&rsquo;t even need to download anything to get going with this, we can just use the WideWorldImporters Sample Database, which is buried in the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples">SQL Server Samples repo on GitHub</a>, as VSTS supports building GitHub hosted projects. If you&rsquo;re following along, you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">create your own fork</a> of the official <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples">Microsoft/sql-server-samples</a> repo, as we&rsquo;ll be adding the YAML build definition to the root of our repo (yes, you need to have a <a href="https://github.com/join">Github Account</a> for this to work). According to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/build-yaml">docs</a>, the only sources currently supported for YAML Build Definitions are Git (hosted in VSTS) and GitHub, so if your code is hosted elsewhere you&rsquo;ll have to wait a while longer.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-dummy-build-definition">Creating a dummy build definition</h3>

<p>Just to make sure everything is working, it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to go ahead and create a trivial build definition now. By convention, this file is called <code>.vsts-ci.yml</code> and is placed at the root of the repo. You can create this directly from the GitHub UI with the &ldquo;Create New File&rdquo; button. <a href="https://github.com/arapaima-uk/sql-server-samples/blob/fa28d3f8803991a20884722e23fe01be6f170ca4/.vsts-ci.yml">Mine</a> just has a single step, which is rather unimaginative:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">steps<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w"></span>-<span class="w"> </span>script<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span>echo<span class="w"> </span>hello<span class="w"> </span>world</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="making-sure-vsts-can-talk-to-github">Making sure VSTS can talk to GitHub</h2>

<p>The easiest way to do this, in my view at least, is to create a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/">Personal Access Token</a> we can use so that VSTS can authenticate to GitHub. The <code>public_repo</code> scope will be adequate for everything we need to do here.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/create-access-token-public-repo.png" alt="Creating a personal access token" /></p>

<p>You will need to copy the value of the token from GitHub as soon as you create it, it won&rsquo;t be accessible again.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/copy-personal-access-token.png" alt="Copying the access token" /></p>

<h2 id="creating-the-project-in-vsts">Creating the Project in VSTS</h2>

<p>Having selected the &ldquo;New Project&rdquo; button, we have a couple of forms to fill in. The first is just to give our VSTS project a name, the rest of the fields can be left at their defaults.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/vst-new-project.png" alt="Creating a new project in VSTS" /></p>

<p>Next, we specify that we are building code from an external repo, and select &ldquo;Setup Build&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/setup-build.png" alt="Building code from an external repo" /></p>

<p>In the next screen, we specify that we are building a project from GitHub, and paste in the access token we created earlier.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/entering-the-access-token.png" alt="entering the personal access token" />.</p>

<p>Finally, we are presented with a list of all the repos our account has access to. We need to find our clone of <code>sql-server-samples</code> in this list and select it.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/select-repo.png" alt="selecting the repo" /></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re presented with a list of build process templates, the one we want is &ldquo;YAML&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/select-yaml-build.png" alt="selecting YAML build" />.</p>

<p>All that&rsquo;s left to do is specify the path to our YAML build definition, in this case <code>.vsts-ci-yml</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/specify-path-to-yaml-file.png" alt="specifying the path to the yaml file" /></p>

<p>Having got this far, we can go ahead and select &ldquo;Save and Queue&rdquo;, and a new build will be created using the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; build definition we created earlier.</p>

<p>If we look at the output of our build, we can see our text being written to the log.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/successful-build.png" alt="building the trivial project" /></p>

<p>Almost all of the elapsed time here was cloning the repo from GitHub, there is quite a lot of stuff in it!</p>

<h2 id="building-the-real-project">Building the real project</h2>

<p>This is all very well, but we haven&rsquo;t managed to build our actual database project yet. To do so, we&rsquo;ll need to go back to GitHub and edit the build definition file.</p>

<p>The documentation for how to specify build steps in YAML is still a <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/tree/master/docs/preview">work in progress</a>. In summary, the current procedure is to visit the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/tree/master/Tasks">VSTS Tasks repo on GitHub</a>, open the folder for the task your are interested in, and take a look at the <code>task.json</code>.</p>

<p>In our case, the first task we need is <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/MSBuild">MSBuild</a>, to build the database project. Looking inside <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/blob/master/Tasks/MSBuild/task.json">task.json</a>, we can see that the name of the task we need is <code>MSBuild</code>, and that there are a huge number of available <code>inputs</code> we can use to configure the task; <code>solution</code> to specify the project or solution to build, <code>platform</code>, <code>configuration</code>, and many more. In our case, we&rsquo;ll just specify the path to our <code>.sqlproj</code> file and let <code>msbuild</code> take care of the rest.</p>

<p>Having built the project, we need to copy our output somewhere so we can use it later. In this case, we&rsquo;ll use the &ldquo;Publish Build Artifacts&rdquo; task to copy the built dacpac file to VSTS.</p>

<p>The complete build definition is shown below. We build the database project with MSBuild, then specify the path to the built artifact to copy. The artifact itself needs a name, so we can reference it later, for instance in a Release Definition, as well as a type. <code>ArtifactType: Container</code> just means that we are storing the artifact in VSTS, rather than in an external file share, for example.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">steps<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="w">    </span>ArtifactType<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span>Container</code></pre></div>
<p>If you take a glance at the history of this file, you&rsquo;ll observe it took me a couple of attempts to get this working; the single quotes turned out to be more important than I originally anticipated. Having overcome that hurdle, we can see that the build succeeds, and produces a single artifact containing our <code>dacpac</code> file.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/github-vsts-yaml/build-succeeded.png" alt="build succeeded and produced an artifact" /></p>

<p>For now, this is where the story ends for YAML builds in VSTS, I&rsquo;ll try to return to this topic later once YAML release management is publicly available.</p>

        <span class="post-date">2018-02-27</span>
        

<p>Someone recently asked me how I did this so I thought I&rsquo;d note it down here in case it&rsquo;s of use to anyone else.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things which I think are prerequisites, namely that this site <a href="http://arapaima.uk">arapaima.uk</a> is <a href="http://arapaima.uk/fixed/blogsetup/#github-setup">hosted on GitHub Pages</a>, and has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">custom domain</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the <a href="https://revealjs.com">reveal.js</a> slides<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:-"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:-">1</a></sup> for the public talks I&rsquo;ve done, at least recently, are themselves hosted on Github, in individual repos such as <a href="https://github.com/arapaima-uk/slides-tsqlt-groupby">this one</a> or <a href="https://github.com/arapaima-uk/database-cd-ssdt-vsts">this one</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>

<p>Now for the science bit. After I&rsquo;ve finished with a talk, I create a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">tag</a> in the repo to indicate which event it was from. Tags are created with the syntax</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git tag -a SQLBits2018 -m <span class="s2">&#34;SQLBits 2018, February 24 2018&#34;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>and can be reviewed by typing <code>git tag</code> to see a list of tags, or <code>git show SQLBits2018</code> to see the commit to which the tag refers:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD database-cd-ssdt-vsts<span class="o">]</span>$ git show SQLBits2018

commit bc5694ee81354a311bb37a457ec5c790ef970f8e <span class="o">(</span>HEAD -&gt; master, tag: SQLBits2018<span class="o">)</span>

    SQLBits Version</code></pre></div>

<p>What the tags enable me to do is show two different versions of the <em>same repo</em> under different urls.</p>

<p>Before we move onto the next stage, we need to explicitly push our tag(s) to the remote (i.e. GitHub) with the command <code>git push --tags</code>.</p>

<h2 id="submodules">Submodules</h2>

<p>The magic happens through the use of the much-maligned <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule"><code>git submodule</code></a> command.</p>

<p>First, I created an empty repo called <code>presentations</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir presentations <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> presentations
git init</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, I clone the repo containing the presentation into a submodule of this empty repo.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD presentations<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$git</span> submodule add https://github.com/arapaima-uk/database-cd-ssdt-vsts database-cd-sqlbits-2018


Cloning into <span class="s1">&#39;/home/gavin/presentations/database-cd-sqlbits-2018&#39;</span>...
remote: Counting objects: <span class="m">233</span>, <span class="k">done</span>.
remote: Compressing objects: <span class="m">100</span>% <span class="o">(</span><span class="m">183</span>/183<span class="o">)</span>, <span class="k">done</span>.
remote: Total <span class="m">233</span> <span class="o">(</span>delta <span class="m">48</span><span class="o">)</span>, reused <span class="m">227</span> <span class="o">(</span>delta <span class="m">42</span><span class="o">)</span>, pack-reused <span class="m">0</span>

Resolving deltas: <span class="m">100</span>% <span class="o">(</span><span class="m">48</span>/48<span class="o">)</span>, <span class="k">done</span>.</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that I am specifying the folder name in which to create the submodule, this will form part of the url of the presentation so it has two purposes; firstly to give the folder a &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; name, and secondly to allow this repo to contain more than one submodule referring to the same source repo, i.e. more than one version of the same presentation, by specifying <code>git submodule add https://github.com/arapaima-uk/database-cd-ssdt-vsts some-other-folder</code>.</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that the clone url of the submodule <em>must</em> use <code>https://</code> rather than <code>git://</code>, or nothing will work. <em>Ask me how I know this sometime.</em></p>

<p>Next, we need to change to the submodule directory, and <code>checkout</code> the tag we created earlier.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD database-cd-sqlbits-2018<span class="o">]</span>$ git checkout SQLBits2018 
Note: checking out <span class="s1">&#39;SQLBits2018&#39;</span>.

You are in <span class="s1">&#39;detached HEAD&#39;</span> state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
<span class="k">do</span> so <span class="o">(</span>now or later<span class="o">)</span> by using -b with the checkout <span class="nb">command</span> again. Example:

  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

HEAD is now at bc5694e... SQLBits Version
<span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD database-cd-sqlbits-2018<span class="o">]</span>$ git status
HEAD detached at SQLBits2018
nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre></div>

<p>This has left our repo suffering from the dreaded &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=git+detached+head">detached head</a>&rdquo; condition, as confirmed above by <code>git status</code>,  and whilst I would ordinarily regard knowing how to recover from this as a key career-enhancing ability, in this instance we don&rsquo;t need to do anything.</p>

<p>Without going into a detailed explanation of <code>git submodule</code>, if we go back to the <code>presentations</code> root directory (<code>cd ..</code>), and do <code>git status</code> again, we can see the following:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD presentations<span class="o">]</span>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with <span class="s1">&#39;origin/master&#39;</span>.

Changes to be committed:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&#34;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&#34;</span> to unstage<span class="o">)</span>

	modified:   .gitmodules
	new file:   database-cd-sqlbits-2018</code></pre></div>

<p>There are no detached heads here, the <code>presentations</code> repo is still on the <code>master</code> branch, and we are adding the <code>database-cd-sqlbits-2018</code> folder as well as modifying the <code>.gitmodules</code> file, which contains a list of submodules as well as the commits to which they point, in this case the &ldquo;detached head&rdquo; tags. (I think the reason mine says <code>modified</code> rather than <code>added</code> is that this isn&rsquo;t the first submodule I&rsquo;ve created.)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing we need to do, which is to prevent <a href="#repo-settings">Github pages</a> from trying to render our <a href="https://revealjs.com">reveal.js</a> presentations using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, Github&rsquo;s &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; static site generator. To do this, we just need to create an empty file called <code>.nojekyll</code> at the root of our repo. I also created a dummy <code>index.html</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD presentations<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$touch</span> .nojekyll
<span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD presentations<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Some Text&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#34;</span> &gt; index.html</code></pre></div>

<p><em>(Yes, this took me a while to figure out. If you don&rsquo;t do this, you will get all sorts of errors reported when you try to publish the site. The index page does get rendered at arapaima.uk/presentations, one day I&rsquo;ll get around to making it prettier, possibly by reading the contents of the submodules and generating it dynamically. However, it isn&rsquo;t linked to anywhere, not even from here!)</em></p>

<p>Finally we need to commit these changes in the main repo, and push them to Github.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD presentations<span class="o">]</span>$ git add .
<span class="o">[</span>gavin@THINKPAD presentations<span class="o">]</span>$ git commit -m <span class="s2">&#34;added sqlbits presentation&#34;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, create the <code>presentations</code> repo in your GitHub account:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/hosting-revealjs-github-pages/createrepo.png" alt="Creating a Repo in the Github UI" />
<em>(yes, I already had a &ldquo;<code>presentations</code>&rdquo;, so this one is called &ldquo;<code>presentation</code>&rdquo;!)</em></p>

<p>then add it as a remote and push your changes:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git remote add origin https://github.com/arapaima-uk/presentations.git
git push -u origin master</code></pre></div>

<p>You can see my <code>presentations</code> repo on Github <a href="https://github.com/arapaima-uk/presentations">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="repo-settings">Repo Settings</h2>

<p>In the settings for the newly created repo, there is a section &ldquo;Github Pages&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Now, because the main site is a Github <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">organisation page</a> with a custom domain, this project page has been created as a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/custom-domain-redirects-for-github-pages-sites/">subdirectory of the main site</a>.</p>

<p>If all is well, and you&rsquo;ve got to here, you should be able to see your presentation on <a href="http://arapaima.uk/presentations/database-cd-sqlbits-2018/">http://arapaima.uk/presentations/database-cd-sqlbits-2018/</a>, substituting your domain for <a href="http://arapaima.uk">arapaima.uk</a> and your presentation title for <code>database-cd-sqlbits-2018</code>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-10-23</span>
        

<h2 id="config-as-environment-variables">Config as environment variables</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the <a href="https://12factor.net/">Twelve-Factor App</a> &ldquo;methodology&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for building and deploying applications, and whilst much of it is geared towards web apps in Heroku-esque environments, I think the principles - or &ldquo;factors&rdquo; - are well worth bearing in mind when considering the delivery of other types of application.</p>

<p><a href="https://12factor.net/config">Factor 3 of the 12</a> reads as follows</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An app’s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys (staging, production, developer environments, etc). This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resource handles to the database, Memcached, and other backing services</li>
<li>Credentials to external services such as Amazon S3 or Twitter</li>
<li>Per-deploy values such as the canonical hostname for the deploy</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of benefits to this approach, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The obvious one about not having credentials stored in source control. Nobody does this anymore, right?</li>
<li>If environment specific information such as server names are stored with the source control, then changes in the infrastructure will result in new commits in the source repo, meaning that the commit history will no longer merely &ldquo;tell the story&rdquo; of the application, but will also contain numerous sub-plots regarding the infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-downside">The downside</h3>

<p>There is some debate over whether environment variables are really the best place for secret information, and there are definitely customers for whom this approach would be considered too high risk. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought these included the customers where the credentials are currently stored with the application source code!</p>

<p>The main alternatives generally revolve around storing credentials somewhere where the infrastructure automation tools - Ansible, etc. - can see them and using these tools to deploy a file which the applications can read.</p>

<h2 id="never-mind-the-downside-on-with-the-weird-trick">Never mind the downside, on with the weird trick&hellip;</h2>

<p>I used the following example of the &ldquo;config as environment variables&rdquo; approach in a recent talk about SSDT and VSTS, using a Powershell Script to read config values from environment variables and deploy a dacpac to a SQL Azure database using SQL Authentication.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-Powershell" data-lang="Powershell">$serverName=$env:Chinook_ServerName
$dbName = $env:Chinook_DatabaseName
$dbUser = $env:Chinook_DbUser
$dbPassword = $env:Chinook_DbPassword

$dacFxDll=&#39;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DAC\bin\Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.dll&#39;

Add-Type -Path $dacFxDll
$dacServices = New-Object Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.DacServices &#34;server=$serverName;User ID=$dbUser;Password=$dbPassword;&#34;

$dacpacPath=Join-Path -Path $PSScriptRoot -ChildPath &#34;\bin\Debug\ChinookDb.dacpac&#34;
$publishProfilePath = Join-Path -Path $PSScriptRoot -ChildPath &#34;CommonSettings.publish.xml&#34;

$dacpac = [Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.DacPackage]::Load($dacpacPath)
$dacProfile = [Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.DacProfile]::Load($publishProfilePath)

$dacServices.Deploy($dacpac, $dbName, $true, $dacProfile.DeployOptions )</code></pre></div>
<p>What this script does, in brief, is load the server name, database name, and credentials from environment variables, and then deploy a <code>.dacpac</code> using this information in addition to a publish profile(<code>CommonSettings.publish.xml</code>) that defines some common - to <em>all</em> environments - deployment configuration.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this approach is that the <em>same</em> deployment script can be used without modification in <em>all</em> environments, from the developer&rsquo;s desktop through the various testing environments and on to UAT and Production.</p>

<p>So, for deployments from the desktop or other unmanaged environments, it is easy to specify these values by setting environment variables.</p>

<p>However, in VSTS, things are a little more complicated. It&rsquo;s possible to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/pools-queues#creating-agent-pools-and-queues">private agent queues</a> to allocate specific build agents - which could have these variables set in advance -  to specific environments, but what if we just want to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/agents/hosted#use-a-hosted-agent">hosted queue</a>?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/releases/">VSTS Release Management</a> allows us to specify variables for each environment in our <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/release/">Release Definition</a>. It&rsquo;s fairly common to see these used as parameters to deployment tasks, but what is possibly less obvious from this interface is that these values are surfaced as <em>environment variables</em> in the build process.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-secret-vars/variablesinreleasedefinition.png" alt="Variables pane in VSTS Release Management" /></p>

<p>This means that our Powershell script above can still work unmodified - except, that is, for the password. This is masked in the screenshot  as it is defined as a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; variable. Secret variables are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/build/variables?tabs=batch#secret-variables">not exposed as environment variables</a>, but can only be passed as arguments to our build steps. What muddies the water slightly is that within living memory <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent/issues/145">secret variables <em>were</em> exposed as environment variables</a>, but this behaviour was &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; some time in 2016.</p>

<h3 id="finally-the-weird-trick">Finally, the weird trick</h3>

<p>In the above example, there is an empty environment variable <code>Chinook_DbPassword</code> for each environment, and a corresponding <em>secret</em> variable that contains the actual password.</p>

<p>We need to add an additional task to our release definition to read the secret variable and surface it as an environment variable. This can be done through the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/blob/master/docs/authoring/commands.md">VSTS logging commands</a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, which are worth checking out as they enable a number of &ldquo;weird tricks&rdquo; in addition to this particular one.</p>

<p>As per the documentation, Logging Commands are invoked by writing the command to standard output, which in the case of PowerShell is done via <code>Write-Host</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-secret-vars/PowerShellStepToReadSecretVariable.png" alt="Release Definition showing PowerShell step to decrypt secret variable" /></p>

<p>In accordance with the &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, we pass the secret variable as an argument to the script, then use the <code>##vso[task.setvariable]</code> command to set the value of the non-secret environment variable to the value of the argument.</p>

<p>In the logs for the release, we can see the non-secret variables being set, with <code>Chinook_dbPassword</code> set to blank (<code>[]</code>).</p>

<pre><code>2017-10-13T12:00:12.1607197Z Environment variables available are below.

<p>This isn&rsquo;t restricted to Release Definitions, the same technique will work in Build Definitions too. This is possibly a less common scenario - as <em>builds</em> shouldn&rsquo;t normally contain environment-specific information - except in cases like database deployment where it&rsquo;s generally necessary to deploy the database <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39443317/can-you-run-sql-unit-tests-tsqlt-during-build-process-in-vsts"><em>somewhere</em></a> before we can do any automated testing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-09-13</span>
        

<p>This came up in a question after a recent talk about database unit testing; I&rsquo;ve done something similar on a client project in the past, and it was in my &ldquo;old&rdquo; talk about testing. I thought I&rsquo;d write it down here in case it&rsquo;s useful to anyone, not least the person who was asking the question.</p>

<p>A <code>.zip</code> file of the complete solution can be downloaded from <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/tSQlt-VsTest/KebabTestDemo.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>For many years, Visual Studio Database Projects - in SSDT as well as in its predecessors - have included an additional template for generating SQL Server Unit Tests.</p>

<h2 id="sql-server-unit-tests">SQL Server Unit Tests</h2>

<p>SQL Server Unit Tests live in a SQL Server Unit Test <em>Class</em>, which is contained in an ordinary (.NET) Unit Test Project.</p>

<p>There is some additional configuration scoped to the Test <em>Project</em>, namely the connection string(s) that will be used to execute the tests, and optionally the name of a database project to deploy before every test run.</p>

<p>The Test Class is an ordinary test class with some boilerplate code supplied as well as a designer for creating SQL Server Unit Tests.</p>

<p>The advantages of using Visual Studio to create our SQL Server Unit Tests are that the ouputs of the test are produced in <code>.trx</code> format, which is well understood by many CI tools, not least the ones from Microsoft, and that the tests can be run by the test runner built into Visual Studio.</p>

<h3 id="the-sql-server-unit-test-designer">The SQL Server Unit Test Designer</h3>

<p>The test designer supports up to three Transact SQL scripts per test, called Pre-Test, Test, and Post-Test, which are run in the order you would expect. There is also the option to create class-scoped scripts for Test Initialize and Test Cleanup, which are run before and after every individual test in the class.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/tSQlt-VsTest/unitTestDesigner.png" alt="The SQL Server Unit Test Designer" /></p>

<p>For each of these scripts, there is the option to add test assertions, which are referred to  &ldquo;Test Conditions&rdquo; in this framework. The built-in test conditions are not particularly flexible, but writing custom test conditions is a topic for another day.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it is almost exactly ten years since the inventor of NUnit (and of other things) decided that common SetUp and TearDown methods <a href="http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/posts/2007/09/why-you-should-.html">probably weren&rsquo;t such a good idea after all</a>, mainly as they make it difficult to see what a test is actually <em>doing</em>.</p>

<p>This is complicated further in SQL Server Unit Tests, as the Pre-Test and Post-Test scripts don&rsquo;t use the same connection as the main Test script, which can lead to even more unexpected results.</p>

<p>So, this example won&rsquo;t make use of the Pre-Test and Post-Test scripts, or of their class-scoped equivalents.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no support for mocks or fakes of any kind in the Visual Studio SQL Server unit testing framework.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is another testing framework that provides just such support, namely <a href="http://tsqlt.org/">tSQLt</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tsqlt">tSQLt</h3>

<p>In the .NET/Java/whatever worlds, after deciding on a Unit Test Framework to use - NUnit, xUnit, MSTest, etc. - we are still faced with a further decision regarding what mocking framework to use, for instance Moq, NSub, Rhino, the Microsoft one that nobody&rsquo;s heard of because it&rsquo;s only in VS Enterprise, etc. etc.</p>

<p>In the case of tSQLt, the Unit Test framework and the mocking framework are bundled together into a single package.</p>

<p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that these components can&rsquo;t be <em>used</em> in isolation from one another.</p>

<h2 id="crossing-the-streams">Crossing the streams</h2>

<p>The present example will demonstrate the use of the mocking facilities of tSQLt in conjunction with the test designer and test runner built into Visual Studio.</p>

<p>There are a few ways of getting the tSQLt objects deployed to where they are needed for testing, the way I use most often is basically <a href="https://the.agilesql.club/Blog/Ed-Elliott/AdventureWorksCI-Step5-Adding-tSQLt-Dacpac-To-The-Solution">this one</a>, whereby we create a <code>.dacpac</code> of just the tSQLt objects (or use one we made earlier!), and create a second database project with a Database Reference of type &ldquo;Same Database&rdquo; to the project we are trying to test, and a reference to our tSQLt <code>.dacpac</code>. The <code>.dacpac</code> file needs to be somewhere in our source folders, as it will be added by path. We also need a reference to the master database, as this is required to build the tSQLt project.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/tSQlt-VsTest/SolutionExplorerView.png" alt="Solution Explorer View showing tsqlt projects" /></p>

<p>In the above illustration, KebabTestDemo is the application we are testing, KebabTestDemo.tSQLt is the database project that contains <em>only</em> the references to our tSQLt dacpac and to master, and KebabTestDemo.Tests is the Unit Test project that contains our SQL Server Unit Test.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;SQL Server Test Configuration&rdquo; dialog, we specify the connection string to use for runnng our tests. This information is stored in the <code>app.config</code> for the test assembly, meaning it is scoped to the <em>project</em> rather than to the individual test <em>classes</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/tSQlt-VsTest/SQLServerTestConfiguration.png" alt="The SQL Server Test Configuration dialog" /></p>

<p>This dialog also allows us to specify that we want to deploy a database project at the start of every test run, so that all of our latest changes get included. The keen-eyed will notice, however, that we can only specify <em>one</em> project here, whereas we have <em>two</em> database projects in our solution. Normally I&rsquo;d just leave this blank and try to remember to deploy my updated project before every test run in Visual Studio, and hope that the CI Server &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; to deploy its projects before its own test runs.</p>

<p>However, there is a solution, outlined in an <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bahill/2009/07/31/deploying-composite-projects-through-a-database-unit-test-run/">MSDN blog post from 2009</a> that allows us to take advantage of this &ldquo;automatic deployment&rdquo; feature from Visual Studio.</p>

<p>In short, we subclass the <code>SqlDatabaseTestService</code> class used in <code>SqlDatabaseSetup.cs</code> to allow us to deploy not one, but two projects from the <code>InitializeAssembly</code> method.</p>

<p>We then call our new code from the <code>InitializeAssembly</code> method in <code>SqlDatabaseSetup</code>:</p>

<h3 id="transactions">Transactions</h3>

<p>One of the features of tSQLt is that all the procedures for running unit tests wrap every individual test in a transaction which is rolled back at the end of the test, meaning that the database is in the same state at the end of the test as at the beginning. This is unquestionably a <em>good thing</em>, as it means that the tests are all independent of one another, and that we don&rsquo;t need to think about test &ldquo;teardown&rdquo; actions.</p>

<p>In the case of Visual Studio unit tests, we need to add this support manually. There are a few ways of doing this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/jj851217.aspx">documented on MSDN</a>, of which I&rsquo;ll consider two.</p>

<p>The first is to insert <code>BEGIN TRANSACTION</code> and <code>ROLLBACK TRANSACTION</code> at the beginning and end of every test script. Whilst this is effective, you need to remember to do it every time. My preferred method requires <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj851217.aspx#Anchor_2">further doctoring of the C# code behind the designer</a> so that every test is wrapped in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.transactions.transactionscope.aspx"><code>TransactionScope</code></a>. The only thing to remember here is that the Distributed Transaction Co-ordinator, better known as MSDTC, must be running on the machine where the test is executed, whether this is on your desktop or on a build server.</p>

<p>The only changes we make are the ones highlighted below; we add a reference to <code>System.Transactions</code> and a member variable of type <code>System.Transactions.TransactionScope</code>. We then initialise this variable in <code>TestInitialize()</code> and call its <code>Dispose()</code> method in <code>TestCleanup()</code>, which will throw away the transaction without committing it.</p>

<p>Now when we run our tests, each individual test will be wrapped in a transaction, which will be disposed of (i.e. rolled back) at the end of the test.</p>

<h3 id="the-test-script">The Test Script</h3>

<p>The test script now consists of only three lines; <a href="http://tsqlt.org/user-guide/isolating-dependencies/faketable/">faking the table</a> used in the test, calling the procedure, and selecting the results.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/tSQlt-VsTest/VSUnitTestWithTsqltMocks.png" alt="The completed Visual Studio Unit Test with tSQLt Mocks" /></p>

<p>The results will be processed by the &ldquo;Test Condition&rdquo; at the bottom of the picture, this is a &ldquo;Data Checksum&rdquo; condition, which is the only way to validate a multi-column, multi-row result using the built-in test conditions.</p>

<p>The checksum is configured using the following dialog; we have to select a database connection to use (in this case, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what that connection is), followed by a query that will return the same result set (including column names) as we expect the result set of the test to return. We then click &ldquo;Retrieve&rdquo; to execute the query, retrieve the results, and populate the checksum value (in this case <code>-1371852473</code>, visible in the screenshot above)</p>

<h2 id="running-the-test">Running the Test</h2>

<p>Having got to here, we are ready to run our test from the Visual Studio Test Explorer. This will re-deploy our project(s) and run the test, wrapped in a <code>TransactionScope</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a bit fiddly to set up, and even more fiddly to set up on a CI Server. However if you have some reason why you want or need to use the built-in testing facilities in Visual Studio, then hopefully this article has demonstrated a way to take advantage of the tSQLt mocking framework.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/tSQlt-VsTest/KebabTestDemo.zip">download the sample project</a>, then the test should build and run the first time, once you set the connection string in the &ldquo;SQL Server Test Configuration&rdquo; dialog.</p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-09-07</span>
        

<p>It&rsquo;s fairly uncontentious to suggest that, all else being equal, providing each developer with an individual &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo;, or private development environment, is a <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/sandboxes.html">worthwhile endeavour</a>.</p>

<p>Often, these can be provisioned on the developers individual desktops, but when the application involves PaaS services such as databases, message queues, and other cloud-based services, things become more complicated. It&rsquo;s generally possible to emulate <em>most</em> things on the desktop, but there are often small gaps in this emulation, not least in the communication and authentication protocols that link the services together.</p>

<p>The rest of this article will discuss how to use <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/">Visual Studio Team Services</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/resource-manager/">Azure Resource Manger</a> (henceforward AzureRM) templates to automatically provision a new environment for every branch created in source control, and automatically destroy the environment using a service hook to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/automation/">Azure Automation</a> when the branch is merged to master and deleted.</p>

<p>I stumbled on this technique whilst working on a proof of concept involving the data-related Azure services, such as Data Factory, Data Lake, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse, but the present example consists of a serverless <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/functions/">Azure Function</a> that writes to a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cosmos-db/">Cosmos DB</a> PaaS Database.</p>

<p>This technique should generalise to most Azure PaaS services, and yes, I&rsquo;m sure you can do similar things with AWS and friends but I haven&rsquo;t had cause to think about them for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="the-application-code">The application code</h3>

<p>The project I&rsquo;m using for this example can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/arapaima-uk/KebabAzureRmDemo">this Github repo</a>. The Github version of the code is mirrored from the version in VSTS using the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.gittasks">Git Tasks</a> extension for VSTS</p>

<p>The repo contains a Visual Studio (2017) solution with four projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>FavouriteKebab - this is the Azure Function App</li>
<li>KebabDbResourceGroup - this is the AzureRM template that defines our infrastructure</li>
<li>KebabTests - contains a single test written with the MSTest framework</li>
<li>HelperScripts - a Powershell Script project containing a single script used in the build pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>The name of the DocumentDB database and collection will be the same in every environment, so I&rsquo;ve just hardcoded them in the file (<code>&quot;kebabDB&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;kebabPreferences&quot;</code>). The other thing to note is that I am passing <code>CreateIfNotExists=true</code> in the binding options for the DocumentDB collection; it turns out to be non-trivial to create the database and the collection from an AzureRM template, so we let the app create them at runtime if required.</p>

<p>Unit Testing enthusiasts will have noticed that this isn&rsquo;t really a Unit Test at all; there are no fakes or mocks, we are using the &ldquo;real&rdquo; dependencies for everything.</p>

<p>If our Azure function were a bit bigger, it would be worth splitting out the &ldquo;core&rdquo; functionality into a separate assembly that <em>could</em> be meaningfully unit tested, but in the interests of brevity I&rsquo;ve not done that here.</p>

<p><em>Integration</em> tests of this kind are pretty common in PaaS projects, and a glance at the <a href="https://github.com/arapaima-uk/KebabAzureRmDemo/blob/master/KebabTests/KebabTests.cs">full source code of the test project </a> will reveal many of the common &ldquo;characteristics&rdquo; of coded integration tests; acres of boilerplate code to read config files and set up the initial conditions, POCOs not present in the main application whose only purpose is to hold data for our test, etc. etc. Still, all of this fragility and maintenance difficulty is probably a price worth paying for increased confidence in our deployment pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="the-azurerm-template">The AzureRM Template</h2>

<p>The thing to note is that the template takes four parameters, each of which has a default value.</p>

<p>Each of the defaults consists of a prefix that identifies the resource type, combined with the result of the function <code>uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)</code>. These unique strings are required as there are some objects in Azure (storage accounts or web apps for example) that require <em>globally</em> unique names that can be incorporated into a url of the form <code>https://myapp.azurewebsites.net</code> or similar. I can never remember which objects do require unique names and which ones don&rsquo;t, so I tend to use <code>uniqueString()</code> for everything.</p>

<p>The template goes on to create a storage account, a Cosmos DB account, a Function App, and all the supporting bits these require. These end up with some pretty funky names thanks to the use of <code>uniqueString()</code>, but since you never really need to type these names anywhere this is more of an aesthetic consideration than a practical problem:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/resources.png" alt="Azure resource names generated with uniqueString" /></p>

<p>This defines three outputs, the Function App name, the Cosmos DB uri, and the Cosmos DB key. This is necessary as we didn&rsquo;t specify these values ourselves, so we need AzureRM to <em>tell us what it just created</em> in order that we can use these names for other tasks in our build process.</p>

<h3 id="the-build-definition">The Build Definition</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/builddefinition.png" alt="The Build Steps in VSTS" /></p>

<p>This is a fairly standard workflow, with a couple of things of note. We build the solution at the beginning and save the artifacts, but before we run our integration test(s?), we run the AzureRM template to &ldquo;Create or Update&rdquo; a resource group, and then deploy our Function App inside this resource group. This is so that we can run our integration tests with the real dependencies. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo;, such as it is, is in the AzureRM deployment step:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/AzureRMStep.png" alt="AzureRM Deploy step showing parameters" />.</p>

<p>By passing the <em>name of the branch we are building</em> as the name of the resource group, this means that the first time we build any given branch we will get a brand new environment with a Cosmos DB, a Function App, etc. etc., exclusively for that build.</p>

<p>After the template is deployed, we need a bit of Powershell to retrieve the outputs from the template.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span class="k">param</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="no">[string]</span><span class="nv">$resourceGroup</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>What this does is to find the most recent deployment for the specified resource group - i.e. the one we just did - and map the <em>outputs</em> of the template to <em>build variables</em> in VSTS by name. This means that for every output in the template, we need to define a build variable with <em>exactly</em> the same name, which indeed we have done:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/buildvars.png" alt="Build variables view" /></p>

<p>The values are all empty, as they will be assigned by the above script during each build.</p>

<p>We can then use these variables in the Function App deployment step to tell it where to deploy our Function:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/appServiceDeploy.png" alt="FunctionAppDeployment" /></p>

<p>as well as in the Integration Testing step, where we use these variables to overwrite the values in the <code>runsettings</code> file used by the <code>vstest</code> test runner.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/runsettings.png" alt="runsettings" /></p>

<p>The final step is just to update the Github mirror of the VSTS repo; in most corporate environments this won&rsquo;t be necessary!</p>

<h3 id="the-build-trigger">The Build Trigger</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/buildtrigger.png" alt="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/buildtrigger.png" /></p>

<p>This build will be run for every new commit on every branch. A moment&rsquo;s reflection will reveal that if the branch is created through the UI on the server, the build will be triggered immediately, as there will be a new branch with a new (to that branch) commit. The first build will always be the slowest, as this is the one that will create the resource group from scratch.</p>

<p>Equally, a new build will be triggered every time the developer pushes new commits to the feature branch, following which the artifacts will be deployed and the integration tests run, <em>in the private environment dedicated to that branch</em>.</p>

<p>Subsequent builds will be faster; the time penalty associated with creating the resource group from scratch is around two minutes in this particular case, using the hosted queue (2:32 to create from scratch, 0:38 to revalidate on subsequent builds). The overall build time is around 5 minutes the first time, and 3 minutes on subsequent runs. (since there&rsquo;s only one integration test, the slowest part is the nuget restore!).</p>

<h3 id="branch-policy">Branch Policy</h3>

<p>In addition to enforcing a build on every commit, we can force another build at the point a pull request is made from our feature branch to master:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/masterbranchpolicy.png" alt="Master branch policy in vsts" /></p>

<p>This will &ldquo;pre-merge&rdquo; our feature branch into master, and trigger a new build. This will have the side effect of creating a new resource group called &ldquo;merge&rdquo;, in which the tests will be run again. However, since the same branch name is used for every pull-request build, the &ldquo;merge&rdquo; resource group will only be created once, and won&rsquo;t be modified unless the AzureRM template changes.</p>

<h3 id="merging-a-pull-request">Merging a Pull Request</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/closingapr.png" alt="Merging a PR" /></p>

<p>This screenshot shows the &ldquo;moment of truth&rdquo; immediately prior to merging a pull request. The &ldquo;pre-merged&rdquo; branch has been built successfully, and when we click &ldquo;Complete Merge&rdquo; the source branch will be deleted. The resource group, however, will still be hanging around incurring charges, and this could become an expensive business if we are creating a new environment for every single feature and never tearing them down.</p>

<h3 id="tearing-down-the-environment">Tearing down the environment</h3>

<p>This is achieved by calling an Azure Automation runbook in a Service Hook from VSTS.</p>

<p>To create the hook, we first need to define our Automation runbook and give it a web endpoint. The integration of Azure Automation and source control is a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;ve stored the body of the runbook in a gist</p>

<p><script src="//gist.github.com/gavincampbell/a12a87477bd38402b310262040509a56.js"></script>.</p>

<p>This script will parse the JSON payload from VSTS, find the source branch name (from the refspec), and delete the resource group with that name. This runbook is associated with an endpoint url, which we provide to VSTS in the Web hook configuration.</p>

<p>The runbook requires an Azure Automation Account.  I have created these in a separate resource group, not &ldquo;managed&rdquo; from VSTS.</p>

<p>We set the event to track to &ldquo;Pull request merge commit created&rdquo; - there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;branch deleted&rdquo; event available here. Remember, the branch gets deleted when the PR is merged, assuming the box is ticked. Notably, we are only firing this event on merges <em>to</em> master.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/servicehookp1.png" alt="Service Hook p1" /></p>

<p>On the second page of the dialog, we just supply the endpoint url for our Automation runbook.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/servicehookp2.png" alt="Service Hook p2" /></p>

<h2 id="release-management">Release Management</h2>

<p>Once the branch is merged to master and its environment torn down, then what? We release the feature, of course:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/releaseprocess.png" alt="Release Management in VSTS" /></p>

<p>This Release definition is triggered on every new build of the master branch. Since the branch is protected by a policy, these will only occur when a pull request has been created, successfully built, reviewed, and merged.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/releasetrigger.png" alt="Release Trigger" /></p>

<p>As soon as the release is triggered, we do a deployment to QA. The &ldquo;little man with a clock&rdquo; next to the &ldquo;Production&rdquo; environment indicated that there is a manual approval required before a release can be deployed to production.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/qatrigger.png" alt="QA trigger" /></p>

<h3 id="the-deployment-process">The deployment process</h3>

<p>As is typical, the Release Definition is much simpler than the Build Definition. In this instance it consists of only two steps, deploying the Azure RM template and deploying the Function to our Function App.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/deploymenttasks.png" alt="Release tasks in VSTS" /></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s notable though, is that we are using the same Azure RM template for QA and Production as we used for the ephemeral development environments. The only difference is that instead of allowing the parameters to default to their &ldquo;unique string&rdquo; values, we explicitly set all these parameters to &ldquo;well known&rdquo; values in the step definition:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/overridetemplateparameters.png" alt="Azure RM Release Step Definition" /></p>

<p>as well as in the step that deploys the function to our function app:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/overrideAppServicename.png" alt="Azure Function Release Step Definition" /></p>

<p>The Production environment definition is exactly the same as the QA one, except that the &ldquo;well known&rdquo; values for the resource names are different.</p>

<p>This means that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the QA and Prod environments are maintained by a different team, or if they are created in a different subscription or in a different tenant; as long as we know the values to plug into our template, we can override our defaults with the &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; names.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; resource names still need to respect the rules for uniqueness though, so if these names are important it is probably wise to create these resources in advance to avoid disappointment at deployment time.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re still reading, you&rsquo;ll be aware that this has been a somewhat &ldquo;epic&rdquo; article. The scenario outlined above allows us to automatically create and tear down a new environment for every single feature. Under normal circumstances, there will be four &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; resource groups, namely &ldquo;QA&rdquo; and &ldquo;Production&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;merge&rdquo; - used for building and testing &ldquo;pre-merged&rdquo; pull requests, and &ldquo;master&rdquo; - used to rebuild and retest &ldquo;master&rdquo; after every merge commit.</p>

<p>The extra resource group for Azure Automation is also visible in this screenshot, as is the resource group for a feature branch, which will be automatically torn down when the branch is merged.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/vsts-azurerm/ResourceGroups.png" alt="resource groups in the Azure Portal" /></p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-06-17</span>
        

<p>In my mind, the ability to do this kind of thing is the really big &ldquo;win&rdquo; with SQL Server on Linux. In their own words,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the &ldquo;works on my machine&rdquo; excuse a relic of the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing <a href="/fixed/speaking/">presentations</a> at conferences and meetups for a few years, so I&rsquo;m familiar with the pain of setting up &ldquo;Demo VMs&rdquo; for SQL Server on Windows. I also have less than fond memories of setting up and maintaining multiple VMs on a single host to reproduce client problems with clustering, replication, etc.; fortunately I don&rsquo;t tend to get involved with this kind of thing too much these days, so it&rsquo;s not in the scope of this example.</p>

<p>Anyway, with the advent of SQL Server on Linux, it struck me that <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, which I&rsquo;d used for some other stuff in the &ldquo;day job&rdquo; might be a way out of this spiral of despair.</p>

<p>The promise is that having set up a couple of config files, we can stand up a new VM with everything configured and in the right place, merely by typing <code>vagrant up</code> at a command prompt, and remove it again by typing <code>vagrant destroy</code>. If we want to keep it around for another day, <code>vagrant halt</code> is at our disposal. We can even <code>ssh</code> to our new VM by typing <code>vagrant ssh</code>, without any fiddling around with keys or passwords.</p>

<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m aware it&rsquo;s possible to manage Windows guests with Vagrant, even from a Windows host, but my experience of trying this is that it&rsquo;s a world of pain, not least because the Windows box files are 800lb gorillas. The most complete attempt I&rsquo;ve seen has been by <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">chocolately</a> creator <a href="https://github.com/ferventcoder/vagrant-windows-puppet">Rob Reynolds</a>, who I suppose has (or had) some fairly unique needs in this area.</p>

<p>My own use case is further complicated by the fact that I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora Linux</a> on the desktop for the last few years, which doesn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> support Virtualbox - though I&rsquo;m aware it does <em>mostly</em> work - but prefers <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org">kvm</a>-based virtual machines which can be managed through a number of utilities, including the supposedly idiot-proof <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Boxes">Gnome Boxes</a>. There are some slightly outdated results from <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=ubuntu-1510-virt">Phoronix</a> that suggest there may be some performance gains from using KVM as opposed to Virtualbox.</p>

<h2 id="anyway-on-with-the-show">Anyway, on with the show&hellip;</h2>

<p>There are three supported platforms (plus Docker) listed on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup">installation guide</a> for SQL Server on Linux, namely Ubuntu, Suse, and RedHat.</p>

<p>Given that, I decided to proceed with the creation of a <a href="https://www.centos.org/">Centos</a> VM, given that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;quite like&rdquo; RedHat, and also has a vendor-created image in the <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/boxes/7">Vagrant Catalog</a> that supports libvirt (almost all boxes, including the Ubuntu ones, are VirtualBox only). Suse also has vendor images for libvirt, but I haven&rsquo;t used Suse Linux since the Spice Girls were topping the charts and wasn&rsquo;t inclined to investigate further.</p>

<h3 id="the-vagrantfile">The Vagrantfile</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/">Vagrantfile</a> is a file called <code>Vagrantfile</code> that is used to tell Vagrant what the VM you want to create needs to look like.</p>

<p>In this case it&rsquo;s fairly simple, but I&rsquo;ve left the autogenerated comments in the version in the <a href="https://github.com/gavincampbell/VagrantSqlServerCentosEtc">github repo that accompanies this post</a> (they&rsquo;re useful if, as is almost certain, you want to reproduce this on a slighly different platform to me, i.e. Virtualbox!), so I&rsquo;ve extracted the highlights to a <a href="https://gist.github.com/gavincampbell/a9b920ff7b1c7f3547aeeca46e186050">gist</a> here.</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/gavincampbell/a9b920ff7b1c7f3547aeeca46e186050.js"></script>

<p>We specify the &ldquo;base box&rdquo;, in this case Centos 7 on which our VM is going to be based. After that, we just specify the ways in which our VM is going to diverge from this base. In our case, we are setting up a forwarded port for 1433, so that clients on the host can connect to the SQL Server as if it were &ldquo;local&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re increasing the default memory allocation to the VM from the default (which I think is 512MB) to 4GB - the minimum requirement for SQL Server on Linux is 3.25, and I have read that the installer will fail if you have less than this available.</p>

<p>After that, we specify a shell script to run to set up everything else; In Vagrant-speak this is known as a &ldquo;provisioner&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Vagrant doesn&rsquo;t have to use shell scripts for configuration, it supports a number of alternative provisioners, such as the usual suspects of <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/">Chef</a>, and <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, in addition to a couple of others.</p>

<p>The advantage of these latter approaches, of course, is that they are idempotent, making the scripts easy to build up over time; I intend to revisit this example, probably with Ansible, once SQL Server on Linux is generally available and the installation procedure is a bit less &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The shell script fetches updates with <code>yum</code> (for those more accustomed to Debian-derivatives such as Ubuntu this is like <code>apt</code>), then adds the Microsoft repository definitions to <code>yum</code>&rsquo;s configuration. It also installs a package called <code>tcping</code> from another repo called <code>epel</code> (which stands for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux), which we&rsquo;re going to need in our script. Having got everything downloaded, we install the SQL Server client and server, which are separate packages.</p>

<p>Not only are they separate packages, they require different mechanisms for accepting the terms of the EULA; one requires an environment variable <code>ACCEPT_EULA=y</code>, and the other requires a parameter <code>accept-eula</code>!</p>

<p>We also pass the top-secret <code>sa</code> password as an environment variable; this is required to run the installation silently.</p>

<p>Having done all that, we wait for the service to start before proceeding. This is why <code>tcping</code> was required, it&rsquo;s among the simplest ways to figure out if there&rsquo;s anything listening on a given port.</p>

<p>Finally, we restore a database from a backup and run a script to install the tSQLt unit testing framework. By default, Vagrant will rsync the folder containing the <code>Vagrantfile</code> to a <code>/Vagrant</code> folder inside our VM, so we can simply put any files we need for provisioning (or for anything else) inside this folder. In this case, I&rsquo;ve extracted the contents of the <code>tSQLt.zip</code> from the <a href="http://tsqlt.org/downloads/">tSQLt downloads page</a>.</p>

<p>Originally, I had the database backup copied from the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples">original repo</a> here too, but had to replace this with a call to <code>curl</code>; I&rsquo;m glad to say I&rsquo;d never run into the Github file size limit before! Obviously this makes the re-provisioning process a bit slower, it&rsquo;s best to have these large file dependencies somewhere local if you can manage it.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-didn-t-do">What we didn&rsquo;t do</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in the (abbreviated) <code>Vagrantfile</code> about networking (other than the forwarded port), storage, logins, cores, etc. etc. All these things are configurable, but the point of this approach is that we trust Vagrant to &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; unless we specify otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="the-moment-of-truth">The Moment of Truth</h2>

<p><code>vagrant up</code></p>

<h2 id="profit">Profit</h2>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/sql-linux-vagrant/vscode.png" alt="vscode on fedora connected to linux on centos in vagrant!" /></p>

<p>To be clear, this is a picture of Visual Studio Code, running on Fedora Linux 25 (the host), connected to SQL Server running on Centos 7.3 (the guest) in a virtual machine provisioned by vagrant. The mssql extension for Visual Studio Code is a very recent alpha; this was to do with .net core compatibility on &ldquo;modern&rdquo; versions of Linux.</p>

<p>The VM is a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; VM, you can see it here in the Fedora Virtual Machine Manager application with the console open showing the SQL Server process:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/sql-linux-vagrant/vmm.png" alt="vagrant vm opened in virt-manager showing the sql server process" /></p>

<h2 id="the-wrap">The Wrap</h2>

<p>I was slightly surprised that all this worked as well as it did; not so much the Vagrant part as the SQL Server on Linux part, which is certainly more complete than when I last looked at it. In particular, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to be able to install tSQLt on Linux - I did have to make a change to the <code>SetClrEnabled.sql</code> script that is distributed with tSQLt to turn off <code>clr strict security</code>, but apart from that it all went pretty smoothly. I have a <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/645/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=63722">presentation about tSQLt</a> to do next month, which was one of the motivations for this exercise, and I&rsquo;ll certainly be setting aside some time in the next day or two to see if everything else works the way one might expect. If you want to try this out at home, and assuming your setup is roughly like mine (kvm rather than Virtualbox, vagrant already working, etc, etc):</p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-05-25</span>
        

<p>For reasons, you might want your <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/multibranch/">Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline</a> jobs to do a different thing depending on which branch is being built.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the multibranch plugin provides us with a built-in variable <code>BRANCH_NAME</code>, which we can use to figure out which branch we are currently building.</p>

<p>In such scenarios, it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to create a minimal <code>Jenkinsfile</code> at the repo root that contains just enough logic to figure out which branch we are on,  and then call another groovy script that contains the actual build definition:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/gavincampbell/480843552e43efa84c60f9bb4840d6c1.js?file=Jenkinsfile"></script>

<p>In this script we load an external groovy file based on the current branch, and then call the function defined therein. In this particular case, the <code>run_build()</code> functions don&rsquo;t do anything particularly exciting, but they probably do enough to demonstrate this mechanism.</p>

<h4 id="the-script-for-the-master-branch">The script for the master branch:</h4>

<script src="//gist.github.com/gavincampbell/480843552e43efa84c60f9bb4840d6c1.js?file=master.groovy"></script>

<h4 id="the-script-for-any-other-branch">The script for any other branch:</h4>

<script src="//gist.github.com/gavincampbell/480843552e43efa84c60f9bb4840d6c1.js?file=not-master.groovy"></script>

<p>The most important line in each of these scripts is the <code>return this</code> at the end; as <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-cps/#code-load-code-evaluate-a-groovy-source-file-into-the-pipeline-script">documented</a>, this is required for the functions to be callable from the outer script. The <code>checkout scm</code> step in the root <code>Jenkinsfile</code> is also required, as without it the rest of the scripts won&rsquo;t be fetched from the repo. All three of these files are in the root of the repo, this is because gist doesn&rsquo;t support folders. In &ldquo;real life&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to create a separate folder for these scripts, and provide the path to the <code>load</code> function.</p>

<h2 id="trying-this-out-at-home">Trying this out at home</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Jenkins server handy, you can create a new one with <code>docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkinsci/jenkins:lts</code><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and connect to it on <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>. After that, it&rsquo;s just a question of creating a new job of type &ldquo;Mutibranch Pipeline&rdquo; and specifying an appropriate name.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Branch Sources&rdquo; section, add a source of type &ldquo;Git&rdquo; (not &ldquo;Github&rdquo;!), and provide it with the path to the source repo, in this case the gist.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-gist-as-a-source-repo">Using a gist as a source repo?</h3>

<p>It might be a lesser known fact about Github that gists are <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/forking-and-cloning-gists/">really just repos with a few extra rules</a> that can be forked and cloned like any other Github repo. What it doesn&rsquo;t say in that linked page is that you can also create branches, even if these new branches aren&rsquo;t visible in the Gist UI. So, if you create a fork of <a href="https://gist.github.com/gavincampbell/480843552e43efa84c60f9bb4840d6c1">https://gist.github.com/gavincampbell/480843552e43efa84c60f9bb4840d6c1</a>, you should end up with an identical gist in your own Github account. You can then paste the url of this gist into the Jenkins job definition as shown:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/jenkins-multibranch-gist/multibranch-pipeline-from-gist.png" alt="Gist url in git scm step" /></p>

<p>The other thing to note here is the checkbox for &ldquo;Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers&rdquo;; since we aren&rsquo;t configuring any push notifications from our git repo, we need to get Jenkins to scan the repo periodically to look for any new branches, or new commits in existing branches. (In my particular case, since the Jenkins instance is just an ephemeral Docker image, there&rsquo;s no route to it anyway.)</p>

<p>When you save the job configuration, Jenkins will scan the source repo, and create the first pipeline job:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/jenkins-multibranch-gist/master-pipeline-job.png" alt="pipeline job for master branch" /></p>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a new branch</h3>

<p>As noted above, there&rsquo;s nothing in the gist UI to support creating new branches. However, if we clone the gist repo to a local folder we can create the branch and push it back to the origin. You can substitute the url to your own fork of the gist in place of mine (there&rsquo;s only one branch in mine, and you don&rsquo;t have permission to create more!). The downside of this approach of using a gist rather than a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; repo is that by default you get a long guid instead of a readable folder name.</p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-04-04</span>
        

<p>This is a short illustration of using a local installation of Jenkins on Windows to build an SSDT project from a local git repo and deploy it to a SQL Server on the same machine.</p>

<p>This is probably useful for a quick demonstration or to understand how the various moving parts fit together, but possibly less applicable to &ldquo;Real Life&rdquo; production environments.</p>

<p>There are no build agents and no git remotes; all the action takes place on the Jenkins master, and the git repo is local to the same machine. No &ldquo;git management&rdquo; software such as GitHub/VSTS/GitLab/BitBucket/etc is involved (except for some slight cheating regarding the build definition itself.)</p>

<h2 id="getting-set-up">Getting set up</h2>

<p>I am using Windows 10 with SQL Server 2016 Developer Edition and Visual Studio 2015 Professional. Most of this stuff should work with most editions and versions of SQL Server and Visual Studio, but some of the paths will vary here and there. I am using SQL Server Data Tools Version 14.0.61021.0, released on October 26, 2016.</p>

<h3 id="installing-jenkins">Installing Jenkins</h3>

<p>I used the windows installer linked <a href="https://jenkins.io/content/thank-you-downloading-windows-installer/#stable">here</a> (note that this link will trigger the download <em>immediately</em>). At the time of writing this is version 2.46.1. In the initial setup, I selected the option to &ldquo;Install Recommended Plugins&rdquo;; this installs more than is required for this example.</p>

<h3 id="further-jenkins-twiddling">Further Jenkins twiddling</h3>

<p>The MSBuild plugin needs to be installed separately (as it isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;<em>recommended</em>&rdquo;!), which can be done from <a href="http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/available">http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/available</a> or by clicking through <em>Jenkins -&gt; Manage Jenkins -&gt; Manage Plugins -&gt; Available</em>. We need to tell Jenkins where it can find <code>MSBuild.exe</code>, this is done on <a href="http://localhost:8080/configureTools/">http://localhost:8080/configureTools/</a> (<em>Jenkins -&gt; Manage Jenkins -&gt; Global Tool Configuration</em>). You can find out where <code>MSBuild</code> is installled by opening the &ldquo;Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio&rdquo; and typing</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bat" data-lang="bat">C<span class="p">:</span><span class="nl">\Program</span><span class="c1"> Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0&gt;where msbuild</span>

<p>I already had git installed and in the path, so there was no need to configure this separately in Jenkins.</p>

<p>By default, the Jenkins service will run as &ldquo;Local System&rdquo; on Windows. In order to allow this account - which will authenticate to SQL Server as the machine account - to deploy the database, I made &ldquo;Local System&rdquo; an <code>sa</code> of the SQL Server:</p>

<p>From here on, everything is local (<em>geddit?</em>).</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-jenkins-job">Creating the Jenkins job</h2>

<p>The first step is to create the Jenkins job that will build our project into a dacpac, and deploy it to a local SQL Server.</p>

<p>The job definition is contained in the following Jenkinsfile, which consists of three fairly self-explanatory stages. The first stage <code>git checkout</code> checks out our master branch from the local (indicated by the <code>file:\\</code> prefix) repo. The second stage calls the <code>MSBuild</code> tool we defined earlier, taking advantage of the fact that our project is very simple to provide very few parameters on the command line. The third calls out to the shell to call <code>sqlpackage.exe</code>, again with very few parameters. This last stage is the one that requires whatever account Jenkins is running under to be able to authenticate to the SQL Server (though there are alternatives involving storing credentials in Jenkins).</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/gavincampbell/e3dfa25abf427752e919eb2110f03852.js"></script>

<p>Conveniently, since this is stored in a GitHub gist, and a gist is a git repo, I can create a new pipeline job and specify &ldquo;Pipeline Script from SCM&rdquo; in the build definition then provide the url of the gist for the repository url.</p>

<p>Note that this repo contains a single file, namely the build definition - all the project files are coming from the git repo on our local machine. If you want to copy and paste the complete url, it&rsquo;s in the build output log reproduced below.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/jenkins-ssdt-git/pipeline-job-from-gist.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Jenkins showing pipeline from SCM" /></p>

<p>One more detail is that the job needs to be set to &ldquo;Poll SCM&rdquo;, but the schedule can be left empty (ignore the warning). This isn&rsquo;t required to test the build, but will be required later on to trigger the build on a commit to our git repo.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/jenkins-ssdt-git/jenkins-job-set-to-poll-with-empty-schedule.PNG" alt="Jenkins Pipeline Job showing Poll SCM Setting with empty schedule" /></p>

<h3 id="testing-the-build">Testing the build</h3>

<p>We should now be able to trigger the build from the Jenkins dashboard, and see some output like the following (under &ldquo;Console Output&rdquo;)</p>

<h2 id="triggering-the-build-from-the-git-repo">Triggering the build from the git repo</h2>

<p>Many approaches to building a project automatically on each commit rely on the CI server, in this case Jenkins, polling the source control system at some pre-defined interval.</p>

<p>However, if the geo-political events of 2016 are any guide, polling doesn&rsquo;t always lead to the outcome we expect, so in this case we&rsquo;ll create a git &ldquo;hook&rdquo; to trigger the build on every commit to master.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" title="Link to git hooks chapter of git book">git hook</a> is a script that runs in response to a specific event that occurs in git. There are a bunch of events that can fire hooks, these can be used to enforce commit message conventions, run static code analysis, prevent force-pushes, and all kinds of other arbitrary busywork. The event that&rsquo;s of interest here is the <code>post-commit</code> hook, which runs <em>after</em> a commit has been added. In &ldquo;Real Life&rdquo;, hooks are normally added to the <em>server</em> copy of the repo but since there&rsquo;s no remote in our setup, everything has to be local.</p>

<p>Notably, even though we&rsquo;re on Windows in this example, hooks are executed by the <code>msysgit</code> subsystem so much of the usual UNIX shell stuff will work.</p>

<p>Hooks are stored in the <code>.git</code> folder in our repo (this is usually hidden on Windows) in files that match the name of the hook. So, our file is called <code>post-commit</code> (no extension) and contains the <code>#!/bin/sh</code> &ldquo;shebang&rdquo; plus a single line that uses <code>curl</code> to hit a specific URL in the Jenkins server that will cause our Jenkins job to poll its source repo as defined in the build pipeline (i.e. <code>file:///C:/Projects/Chinook.JenkinsDemo</code> )</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bat" data-lang="bat">C<span class="p">:</span><span class="nl">\Projects\Chinook.JenkinsDemo\.git\hooks</span><span class="c1">&gt;type post-commit</span>
#!/bin/sh
curl http://localhost:8080/git/notifyCommit?url=file:///C:/Projects/Chinook.JenkinsDemo</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note for <code>git</code> beginners: this file isn&rsquo;t in the repo when you download it, you&rsquo;ll need to add it yourself!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, all that remains is to make an arbitrary change to our project and add a commit.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/jenkins-ssdt-git/changed-table-with-commit-dialog.PNG" alt="Visual Studio showing changed table and commit dialog" /></p>

<p>If everything is working the pipeline job should be triggered, and the new build will also log that it was &ldquo;Started by an SCM Change&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aksidjenakfjg/jenkins-ssdt-git/build-started-by-scm-change.PNG" alt="Build Triggered by SCM Change" /></p>

<p>To clarify what&rsquo;s happened here, we made a change and committed it to our local repo, the <code>post-commit</code> hook called the url in Jenkins, and Jenkins then &ldquo;polled&rdquo; the git repo, found a new commit, and triggered the pipeline job.</p>

<p>Until next time, happy triggering!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you commit the change from the <code>git</code> command line, you may see output along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -am &quot;add shoesize to artist table&quot;

<p>The &ldquo;error&rdquo; message is nothing to worry about, as long as the line &ldquo;Scheduled Polling of <em>myJobName</em> is present then everything is hunky-dory!</p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-03-16</span>
        

<h1 id="how-ssdt-can-help-with-restoring-a-sql-server-database-to-just-before-that-last-deployment">How SSDT can help with restoring a SQL Server database to &ldquo;just before that last deployment&rdquo;</h1>

<p>For as long as I can remember, SSDT and its predecessors have had the option to &ldquo;Back up database before deployment&rdquo;, currently available in the &ldquo;Advanced Publish Settings&rdquo; dialog, among other places. Regrettably, I&rsquo;ve never really had much use for this particular option. Whilst restoring from backup might be a valid strategy for recovering from some kinds of deployment disaster, this could add a great deal of time to the deployment process, assuming a database of non-trivial size.</p>

<p>In any case, there are really only two kinds of database - the ones where you don&rsquo;t care about the data, such as development and test environments, and the ones (one?) where you do. In the former case, backups don&rsquo;t matter anyway, and in the latter case it is to be hoped that there is already some kind of backup solution in place, ideally managed by someone who isn&rsquo;t you.</p>

<p>Further, the &ldquo;Backup database before deployment&rdquo; option appears not to offer much control over <em>how</em> the database is backed up. The backup will be created in the default backup directory of the instance, and will be a <em>full</em> rather than a <em>copy only</em> backup, which has the potential to endanger the &ldquo;real&rdquo; disaster recovery plans in the event that these include differential database backups, as the SSDT-generated backup will reset the differential base, meaning <em>this</em> backup, which the DBAs don&rsquo;t even know about,  will be necessary, along with the subsequent differentials, in case the database needs to be restored.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s likely that the &ldquo;real&rdquo; backup strategy will involve some combination of full, differential, and transaction log backups, and if you&rsquo;re especially lucky will be managed by some kind of &ldquo;Enterprise Backup Solution&rdquo;, which will allow rapid restores to any point in time, just as soon as you figure out where it is that the &ldquo;Enterprise Backup Solution&rdquo; keeps the backup files for your database.</p>

<p>So, assuming the worst case scenario has arisen, your newly deployed release has been writing rubbish data to the database for the last few hours, the &ldquo;war room&rdquo; has been convened and someone you&rsquo;ve never heard of called the &ldquo;Problem Management Executive Consultant&rdquo; has decided that the right course of action is to &ldquo;Restore the database to immediately before the deployment&rdquo;, how are you to decide when this was?</p>

<p>Well, hopefully you know from your release logs what time the database was deployed, but what if there was a better way? And what if you aren&rsquo;t sure what timezone the deployment server is in or whether it uses daylight savings time? Well, one solution to this involves a somewhat neglected feature of SQL Server known as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188929.aspx#Anchor_3">Marked Transactions</a>.

<p>The syntax <code>BEGIN TRANSACTION</code> <em>tran-name</em> <code>WITH MARK 'Mark Description'</code> will record the name of the transaction in the transaction log, along with the date, time, LSN, etc. The description is optional, but that gets saved too.</p>

<p>We can see this in action using the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143221.aspx"><code>pubs</code></a> database, which if you&rsquo;re younger than a certain age, sadly isn&rsquo;t what you think.</p>

<p>Note that if you&rsquo;re playing along at home, there are a couple of extra considerations; the database needs to be using the full (or bulk-logged) recovery model and <em>a full backup must already have been taken</em>, i.e. the database is not in the <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/new-script-is-that-database-really-in-the-full-recovery-mode/">pseudo-simple</a> recovery model.</p>

<p>The <code>logmarkhistory</code> table in <code>msdb</code> also stores a list of our marked transactions:</p>

<p>So, it seems we can use this functionality to give us a named point in the transaction log to restore to in the event of career-threatening disaster.</p>

<p>The thing to note is that we need to update <em>something</em> in the database where we&rsquo;re creating the mark, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter <em>what</em> we update. It&rsquo;s often useful to have a <code>Releases</code> table in our databases where we can store the version number, date, and other fun facts about our database, so this is as good a candidate as any.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-SQL" data-lang="SQL"><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">dbo</span><span class="p">].[</span><span class="n">Releases</span><span class="p">]</span>

        <span class="c1">--Not taking any chances with the time zone!
</span><span class="c1"></span>
<span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We need to create this table and add it to our database project.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a proc to do the inserting:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-SQL" data-lang="SQL"><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">PROCEDURE</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">dbo</span><span class="p">].[</span><span class="n">spFireInTheHole</span><span class="p">]</span>
	<span class="o">@</span><span class="n">ReleaseVersion</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">AS</span>
<span class="k">BEGIN</span> <span class="n">TRANSACTION</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="n">ReleaseVersion</span> <span class="k">WITH</span> <span class="n">MARK</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="n">ReleaseVersion</span> 
  <span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">dbo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Releases</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ReleaseVersion</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="n">ReleaseVersion</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">COMMIT</span> <span class="n">TRANSACTION</span>
<span class="k">RETURN</span> <span class="mi">0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now for the tricky part&hellip;</p>

<p>The <em>first</em> time we deploy the database project after adding these objects, they won&rsquo;t be present in the target database, so we won&rsquo;t be able to call them from the pre-deployment script. This means we need to wrap them with <code>IF EXISTS</code> in the pre-deployment script so that they don&rsquo;t get called if they don&rsquo;t exist. The drawback of this approach, naturally, is that &ldquo;Release 0.0.1&rdquo; won&rsquo;t be recorded in your database for posterity. In my experience of such matters, the gap between Release 0.0.1 and Release 0.0.2 is normally measured in minutes rather than years, so I&rsquo;m not particularly concerned about this.</p>

<p>Finally, we are going to use a <code>sqlcmd</code> <em>variable</em> to hold the release number; this means we can pass it in at deployment time. Most deployment tools know how to do this, for this example we&rsquo;ll just pass it on the command line.</p>

<p>Now, after we build our <code>dacpac</code>, we supply the version number at deploy time:</p>

<pre><code>sqlpackage.exe /Action:Publish /SourceFile:pubs.dacpac /TargetServerName:(local) /TargetDatabaseName:pubs /v:ReleaseVersion=0.2.0

</code></pre>

<p>If we run a few &ldquo;Releases&rdquo;, we can see the marks building up in <code>msdb..logmarkhistory</code>:</p>

<p>In this particular setup, you&rsquo;ll get an error if you try to supply the same version number more than once, as <code>ReleaseVersion</code> is the primary key of the <code>Releases</code> table.</p>

<h3 id="disaster-strikes">Disaster Strikes</h3>

<p>So, the career-threatening disaster has happened, and we need to restore our database to its state immediately prior to release 0.6.0. If there hasn&rsquo;t been a log backup since the deployment, the first step is to make one.</p>

<p>Then, with a bit of DBA magic, we can restore our database to just before the deployment started. I generated these scripts from SQL Server Management Studio, unless you&rsquo;ve got a competent adult handy I suggest you do the same. The crucial bit is in the last line where we specify <code>STOPBEFOREMARK</code>, which is exactly what we want to do.</p>

<p>And with that, the database is restored to its state immediately prior to the deployment - you can check this by looking at the <code>Releases</code> table - , and all that is left to do is blame the guy that left last month for the &ldquo;rogue code&rdquo; that &ldquo;crept&rdquo; into the release. This is normally possible by editing old git commit messages and force pushing the master branch, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">2017-02-28</span>
        

<p>I finally got around to looking into <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester">Pester</a> for test-driven development with PowerShell. In case it&rsquo;s useful to anyone, and so that I don&rsquo;t lose it, I created a script to download the latest release version, store it in the user&rsquo;s PowerShell modules folder, and run a quick test to make sure everything is working. The script is stored in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/gavincampbell/05c803654ff70d21d538b49f0e363a6a">GitHubGist</a> and is reproduced below. Some of the cmdlets require a fairly recent version of PowerShell, possibly even 5.0. The steps are roughly as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Figure out what the latest release number is.</li>
<li>Assemble the correct url to download the zip file.</li>
<li>Download and &ldquo;Unblock&rdquo; the zip file.</li>
<li>Figure out where the user&rsquo;s modules folder is and create it if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. I had to exclude the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vscode</a> modules folder for this to work for me.</li>
<li>Unzip the downloaded file to the right place.</li>
<li>Import the newly installed modules.</li>
<li>Scaffold a test with <code>New-Fixture</code>. The name is randomised to minimise the chance of overwriting something that&rsquo;s already there.</li>
<li>Hack the generated files about a bit.</li>
<li>Run the test.</li>
<li>Clean up the generated files.</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>
